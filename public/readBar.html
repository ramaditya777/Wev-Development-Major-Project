        <p> About 6 months ago, I joined a gym.
            Every morning, there is one personal trainer there that works out at the same time that my little group does
            our workout.
            He does his "routine" with such a quiet determination that he makes it all look very easy; although I know
            all too well how hard he is working.
            When I am tempted to whine and quit, I watch him push himself to his own limits, and I find myself motivated
            to work as hard and without complaint. </p>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I was watching him do chin ups.
            He made them look effortless.
            I broke away from my group and asked him if I could try a chin up.
            I had never tried before, but he just made it look so easy.
            He eagerly stepped aside and encouraged me to step up to the bar.
            I pulled myself up without thinking...once...then twice.
            That was all I had in me, I had no strength left.
            I told him that was all I had, so he stepped up behind me and pushed me up for a third and fourth "pull."
            It felt so good.
            I felt strong and I smiled from ear to ear.</p>
        <p>The next day when I was done my workout, I asked him to spot me again. Again, I did two.
            Again on day three and so on.
            I thought it was pathetic that I could only do two, but when I came to the gym at the end of the week, he
            was standing there just shaking his head.
            When I asked him what was up, he said he was impressed with my chin ups.
            He told me that when they are training firefighters, the men are required to do 5 chin ups, and women are
            required to do 1 or 2.
            He explained that most people can't do them at all, and that he was impressed that I could.
            He further told me that if I practiced every day, I would be doing 5 or 6 in no time.
            At this point I should probably add that I am 50 years old...and female.</p>
        <p>The moral of this story...because I didn't know any better, because he told me I could, I saw no reason to
            doubt.
            I just jumped in and gave it a try - and I did it! I didn't see it as a great accomplishment, because I
            didn't realize that it was difficult and it became my goal to get stronger.
            No one told me I couldn't do it, in fact, I was encouraged to try.
            Had he told me initially how difficult it was, I more than likely would not have tried at all.
            Or I might have tried, but given it only half an effort, because failure would have been the expectation.
            I applaud him for letting me believe that for me, it was not only a possibility, but that success was a
            realistic expectation.</p>
        <p>How many times have we decided not to try at all because we were told that we couldn't, that we shouldn't,
            that we had expectations that were too ambitious?
            How many times have we told our children, our friends and our co-workers that they couldn't do something;
            that their ideas were impossible or beyond reach?
            How many times have we told ourselves that we would fail before we even started?</p>
        <p>I started to ponder examples that I had witnessed and this came to mind...I recalled a conversation a friend
            of mine had with his daughter just prior to her heading off to university.
            He spoke to her (with good intentions) of how hard she would have to work in order to succeed.
            University wasn't like High School - this was the real world and now she would have to grow up.
            This child quit after two years.
            Another friend spoke to her daughter of the adventure she was embarking on and how proud she was.
            I remember how we laughed because the mother already had her outfit picked out for convocation day!
            This child just graduated with her degree in physiology.
            Looking back, neither daughter was more intelligent than the other.
            Was it the silent expectations (or lack thereof) that predicted the outcome?</p>
        <p>I have a new approach now.
            I have experienced first hand how good it feels to rush in so innocently.
            To believe that we CAN do it and go on to accomplish exactly what we set out to do, because no one told us
            we couldn't.
            I've learned how important it is to support others (and ourselves) in our endeavors and to let them know
            that we believe they can do it rather than telling them we think that they can't.</p>
        <p>I personally want to be like my trainer; standing there behind the people that I love, encouraging them,
            believing in them and being ready to catch them when they get tired.
            I will be the one that is there on the second and third day making sure they try again, because I know they
            CAN.
            What a powerful lesson this has been for me.
            I'll be doing "5" in no time at all.
            Because I was told I CAN.</p>
        <p>First, we need to believe in ourselves knowing we have the capabilities in achieving our desires.
            Like the Sunflower, it knew it had the capability to overcome its obstacle because it trusted in the
            Universal Truth and had faith it would succeed.</p>
        <p>Stand tall like the Sunflower and be proud of who and what you are and the environment will begin to support
            you.
            You will find a way to go under or around your big obstacle in order to reach your desires.</p>
        <p>If I wanted to be confident, I had to create the feeling of confidence, and the universe would respond by
            helping me succeed.
            If I hoped to be wealthy, I needed to create a feeling of richness and abundance, and the universe would
            bring me prosperity.
            I understood that what I co-created might not come in the form I expected. (For instance, maybe I'd draw in
            new clients, but it would be through an unexpected avenue - or I'd get the money I was seeking not by
            acquiring additional business, but through another source).
            Of course, I had to work to make the most of the opportunities that the universe presented to me, but I now
            knew that I didn't have to continue to frantically struggle to achieve my goals. I could attract the
            situations that mirrored my feelings of happiness, abundance, and confidence.
            When I began to genuinely believe that I'm more than what I have - that I'm not defined by what I've
            achieved, and I don't have to point to material goods as evidence of my worthiness - my life started to
            change dramatically.
            I created the emotions that I wanted to feel, and the newfound power within me allowed me to grow and
            prosper as I'd never done before in my life.</p>
        <p>Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever
            could, and for that I will always be thankful.
            He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and
            learn to love truly and deeply.
            To give my total to those I cared for.
            Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for meâ€¦I will always try to be
            Ugly.</p>
        <p>A friend of mine opened his wife's underwear drawer and picked up a silk paper wrapped package: "This, - he
            said - isn't any ordinary package." He unwrapped the box and stared at both the silk paper and the box.
            "She got this the first time we went to New York, 8 or 9 years ago. She has never put it on. Was saving it
            for a special occasion.
            Well, I guess this is it. He got near the bed and placed the gift box next to the other clothings he was
            taking to the funeral house, his wife had just died. He turned to me and said:
            "Never save something for a special occasion. Every day in your life is a special occasion".</p>
        <p>I still think those words changed my life.
            Now I read more and clean less.
            I sit on the porch without worrying about anything.
            I spend more time with my family, and less at work.
            I understood that life should be a source of experience to be lived up to, not survived through.
            I no longer keep anything.
            I use crystal glasses every day.
            I'll wear new clothes to go to the supermarket, if i feel like it.
            I don't save my special perfume for special occasions, I use it whenever I want to.
            The words "Someday..." and "One Day..." are fading away from my dictionary.
            If it's worth seeing, listening or doing, I want to see, listen or do it now.</p>
        <p>I don't know what my friend's wife would have done if she knew she wouldn't be there the next morning, this
            nobody can tell.
            I think she might have called her relatives and closest friends.</p>
        <p>She might call old friends to make peace over past quarrels.
            I'd like to think she would go out for Chinese, her favourite food.
            It's these small things that I would regret not doing, if I knew my time had come.
            I would regret it, because I would no longer see the friends I would meet, letters... letters that i wanted
            to write "One of this days".
            I would regret and feel sad, because I didn't say to my brothers and sons, not times enough at least, how
            much I love them.</p>
        <p>Now, I try not to delay, postpone or keep anything that could bring laughter and joy into our lives.
            And, on each morning, I say to myself that this could be a special day.
            Each day, each hour, each minute, is special.</p>
