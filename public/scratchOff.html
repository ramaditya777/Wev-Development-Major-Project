            <h1>Mistakes are always part of learning.</h1>
            <p>People are bound to make mistakes, its simply inevitable, being prepared beforehand may help a bit, but
                at the end you cannot fully predict what may happen. It's just how it goes,people naturally cannot
                foretell with certainty what's going to happen or how things will turn out. Mistakes are one impending
                chunk of life, whereas positive or negative, it would all depend on many factors.

                Mistakes are sort of a way to learn, but for one to learn from a mistake one has to admit his mistake
                first.It may sound easy, admit your mistake and be done with it, but that may not exactly be the case.
                For some people admitting their mistake would mean they are inferior or incompetent, that may come up
                with a major blow to their ego and even their mental state.</p>
